# RecipeSearchApplication
Search for recipes based on their name, cooking time or the name of an ingredient.

The program reads the recipes from a file that the user provides.

Each recipe consists of three or more rows in a recipe file. The first row is for the name of the recipe, the second the cooking time (an integer), and the third and possibly following rows list the ingredients used in the recipe. An empty row follows the last ingredient row. There can be many recipes in a single file.
